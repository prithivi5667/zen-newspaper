            Having hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021 was postponed indefinitely on Tuesday. The decision ends a month-long relatively smooth run for cricket’s most glamorous event. On Wednesday, some players began to reach home even as some overseas players continued to stay in the country. CSK batting coach Mike Hussey, who was one of the personnel to test positive inside the IPL bubble, will also stay out a minimum 10-day stay in India.

            Google CEO Sundar Pichai pushes for new ‘hybrid workplace’ model in email to employees
           </h2>
           <img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/05/Google.jpg">
           <p>
            Google is reimagining the office and post Covid-19 workplace environment through a series of new initiatives. On Wednesday, in an email sent to employees, Google’s chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said the company a workforce where about 20 per cent of the staff would work from home on a permanent basis, while another 20 per cent would shift to new offices. The rest 60 per cent of the staff will be working from their current location.

“We’ll move to a hybrid work week where most Googlers spend approximately three days in the office and two days wherever they work best,” Pichai said in the email. “There will also be roles that may need to be on site more than three days a week due to the nature of the work,” he added.

Google will offer four weeks per year where staff can work from anywhere with manager approval. The idea, as per the MountainView, California-based tech giant, is to give everyone “more flexibility” around summer and holiday travel.
